### **About**

This is repo for my visual basic .NET framework code , where at my conestoga college for the course Robotics and Automation(Co-op), i had a course on VB.Net , where used to learn VB.net for the coding of the PLC and Visual interface(factory talk view)

### **Find Real Roots**
In this assignment, I wrote a program using Visual Basic 2019 to find real roots of a quadratic equation. Three coefficients of a quadratic equation are to be entered through three textboxes; calculation process is initiated (or called) by clicking a button; and the results are then displayed on two labels.

### **Load Moments**

In this assignment, i wrote program to find the 
moments on a statically-loaded beam as the beam is raised 
in fixed angular steps from horizontal to some final angle. A 
load moment is calculated at each position. The mass of the 
load in kilograms, the length of the beam in meters, and the 
incremental steps of the angle in degrees, are to be entered 
as inputs. In addition, while the angle changes at each step, 
the beam position changes, which results in a change in the 
load moment; thus, you also need to enter how many 
positions you want to include in your calculations. The 
results of load moments are to be displayed in a list box.

### **Spindle Speed**

In this assignment, you will develop a spindle speed calculator to create a table of required spindle rpm values 
for a range of stock diameters and cutting speeds. You will use Controls that will simplify error checking code 
and make the display user friendly.

### **String_arrays**
In this assignment, you will write a program to parse strings in various ways, and create and manipulate arrays.

### **SPC_PartsAnalysis**

This assignment is a statistical quality control application that retrieves the output from a part inspection 
machine that has previously measured a bunch of machined parts. Using these measurements, our program 
will sort the individual parts into lists according to whether the part’s machined size is

• under-sized (in which case it is classified as scrap)

• over-sized (in which case it can be returned for further machining)

• within spec (in which case the part is acceptable)

Sometimes, data like this is read in real-time (as it is generated by the inspection machine). In other cases, the 
inspection machine saves its measured results to a text file which then serves as a permanent record of the 
measurements and which can be read and analyzed at a later date. That is what we’ll do here.
The measurements from all the parts have previously been stored in a text file. The record of each part includes 
its part code and measured size. That data is stored in the order in which the parts are measured as they come 
off the machining line.
This assignment reads the data from the text file and, based on the specified acceptable size range, sorts the 
parts into three categories depending on whether they are under-sized, over-sized, or acceptable
